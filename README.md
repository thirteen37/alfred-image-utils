# Alfred Image Utilities

A collection of basic [file actions](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/tips-and-tricks/file-actions-from-alfred-or-finder/) to convert and transform images in [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

## Available actions

* Convert to JPEG
* Convert to PNG
* Rotate 90°, 180°, 270°
* Resample/resize to fit

## Installation

Download the workflow from [Releases](https://github.com/thirteen37/alfred-image-utils/releases/latest). Install in Alfred.

## Usage

1. Select your image files. You can use Alfred to find it and press `→`, or `Cmd + Alt + \` from Finder (now called [Universal Actions](https://www.alfredapp.com/universal-actions/)). Multiple selection is supported.
2. Choose your action from the list.

Conversions will create a new file with the appropriate extension. Transformations will replace the existing file.
